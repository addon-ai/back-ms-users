## Smithy Service Generator Requirements

### Documentation Standards

All Smithy files MUST include comprehensive documentation using the `@documentation` trait for:

#### 1. Services
- Service purpose and functionality overview
- Key features and capabilities
- Usage context and business domain

#### 2. Operations
- Operation purpose and behavior
- Input/output expectations
- Business rules and constraints
- Error conditions and handling

#### 3. Structures
- Structure purpose and usage
- Business context and relationships
- Data validation rules

#### 4. Structure Fields
- Field purpose and meaning
- Data format requirements
- Validation constraints
- Optional vs required context
- Business rules affecting the field

#### 5. Enums
- Enum purpose and usage
- Each enum value meaning and context

### Documentation Format
```smithy
@documentation("Clear, concise description explaining the purpose, behavior, constraints, and business context")
```

### Example Implementation
```smithy
@documentation("A service for managing user accounts with full CRUD operations and search capabilities.")
service UserService {
    // operations
}

@documentation("Creates a new user account. Username and email must be unique. Password minimum 6 characters.")
operation CreateUser {
    // definition
}

structure CreateUserRequest {
    @documentation("Unique username for the user account. Must be 3-50 characters and unique across system.")
    username: String,
    
    @documentation("User's email address. Must be valid email format and unique across system.")
    email: String
}
```

This documentation will be used by code generators to create comprehensive API documentation, improve code readability, and provide context for developers using the generated services.
